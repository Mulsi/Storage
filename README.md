## 3rd weekly lab in Web technologies

## Description
We learned how to use leveldb through postman. We are able to send some metrics from postman to our local host. 

## Instructions
To run the program we go into our source file command prompt and type npm start to get the server running.
After, we go to our postman application and send a raw json file to the url (http://localhost:8080/metrics) where we can see a simple timestamp.
